Had a lot of fun there. Met with old friends, old colleagues, and my Ph.D advisor. 

My presentation was correspondence based Peridynamics. This was the work started last year when I relocated to Brown as a postdoc. We spent a while to discover the essences underlying the state-based formulation and eventually discovered that this class of PD belongs to the traditional continuum approach under the nodal quadrature. Now, we could possibly explain that the instability raised in correspondence-based PD is due to the insufficient evaluation of the energy (Rank deficiency). Finally, of course we solved it by introducing the natural stabilization technique in meshfree methods!
